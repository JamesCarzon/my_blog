   abstract = {In this paper, we study the distribution of the minimal distance (in the Hamming metric) of a random linear code of dimension $k$ in $\mathbb\{F\}_q^n$. We provide quantitative estimates showing that the distribution function of the minimal distance is close (\{\it\{\}superpolynomially\} in $n$)to the cumulative distribution function of the minimum of $(q^k-1)/(q-1)$ independent binomial random variables with parameters $\frac\{1\}\{q\}$ and $n$. The latter, in turn, converges to a Gumbel distribution at integer points when $\frac\{k\}\{n\}$ converges to a fixed number in $(0,1)$. Our result confirms in a strong sense that apart from identification of the weights of proportional codewords, the probabilistic dependencies introduced by the linear structure of the random code, produce a negligible effect on the minimal code weight. As a corollary of the main result, we obtain an improvement of the Gilbert--Varshamov bound for $2<q<49$.},

   abstract = {For any integral convex polytope in R 2 there is an explicit construction of an error-correcting code of length (q − 1) 2 over the finite field F q , obtained by evaluation of rational functions on a toric surface associated to the polytope. The dimension of the code is equal to the number of integral points in the given polytope and the minimum distance is determined using the cohomology and intersection theory of the underlying surfaces. In detail we treat Hirzebruch surfaces. 1 Toric codes Let M Z 2 be a free Z-module of rank 2 over the integers Z. Let be an integral convex polytope in M R = M ⊗ Z R, i.e. a compact convex polyhedron such that the vertices belong to M. Let q be a prime power and let ξ ∈ F q be a primitive element. For any i such that 0 ≤ i ≤ q − 1 and any j such that 0 ≤ j ≤ q − 1, we let P ij = (ξ i , ξ j) ∈ F * q × F * q. Let m 1 , m 2 be a Z-basis for M. For any m = λ 1 m 1 + λ 2 m 2 ∈ M ∩ , we let e(m)(P ij) = (ξ i) λ 1 (ξ j) λ 2. Definition 1.1. The toric code C associated to is the linear code of length n = (q − 1) 2 generated by the vectors \{(e(m)(P ij)) i=0,...,q−1;j =0,...,q−1 | m ∈ M ∩ \}. (1) In [3] we presented a general method to obtain the dimension and a lower bound for the minimal distance of a toric code. We obtained the following results.},
