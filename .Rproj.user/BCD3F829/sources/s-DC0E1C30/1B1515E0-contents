It is imperative that you establish your chess skill level as soon as possible. 
There is simply too much at stake to live your 21st century life in tactical 
darkness. If you seriously think 
that you can walk around inside this world with nothing but the minimal 
knowledge of how the pieces move and still hold your head high at night, then 
you've already lost. Mark my words, you will be the one left sitting on the 
curb 
outside Pizza Hut with your 
confidence shattered and your carpal tunnels throbbing while a confederacy of 
twelve-year-olds will be standing 
around you with their hands making knight-jump-shapes on their acne-ridden foreheads. There is no coming back from this disaster.

As a kid, I did not believe myself to be mathematically competent,
and I assumed that good play of chess required some sort of talent for 
calculation. 
When I started playing chess in college, I marvelled at my opponents' good 
fortune. I thought to myself as I lost time and again, _I'd done nothing wrong!
I traded pieces for pieces, I didn't walk into check, and I kept my queen next 
to my king! How could I have lost?_

The circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic kindled a change in my attitude 
about the game. I found it to be an opportune activity to share remotely with 
my friends and a skill in which I was certainly capable of improving. The 
practice of learning to play better chess (as opposed to the practice itself of 
playing chess) is very satisfying now, because I no longer embarrass myself and 
have a renewed admiration for my ability to cling to mediocrity in a broad 
range of skills in which most people either find great success or total disdain.

This post is a reflection of my current state in the hobby of online chess. As 
an educational exercise and for curious readers, I want to document my thought 
process qualitatively a little. Additionally, in the interest of learning more 
about how my progress is measured, I investigate the "elo rating." This investigation I 
share with you now.

# Elo as proxy

It would be convenient to know your genuine world ranking in chess like how you 
know your height, but you can't practically determine such a thing. The only 
way to decide how good people really are is to make everyone play against 
everyone else infinitely many times and then line up in such a way that 
no one is standing behind someone against whom they win more than half of the 
time. But such a tournament is impractical since we would not have anyone to 
wash our clothes or to clean after the horses on Mackinac Island, and so we 
will never know how good we really are.

But it is rather obvious that we may guess how good we are at the game, and to 
guess with improving certainty with more and more play, without ever actually 
measuring skill. To have a good guess, let's just order everyone that you've 
played against according to your win percentage against them. You can stand in 
front of the 
people against whom you normally win, but you must stand behind those who beat 
you. How good is the person standing in front of you? And behind? Average their 
true rankings to approximate your own.

Of course, this solution is no good since your opponents don't know 
their true rankings either.

In order to make up numbers to represent skill level, the elo rating system 
depends on the simple premise that a player's true ability is not perfectly 
represented in any one game. Sometimes they play better than average and other 
times they play badly. Then, for example, if they are supposedly at rating $X$ 
and they are winning 
frequently against players of ratings greater than $X$, then this is a sign 
that their rating is underestimated and should be increased. Usually, a 
player's performance is assumed to respect a curve that looks like the 
following graph.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_function(fun = dgumbel, 
                n = 100, 
                xlim = c(-3,6)) +
  ylab("Probability of realization") +
  xlab("Some variable of interest")
```

This curve is of an "extreme value distribution," also known as the Gumbel 
distribution. That is, it is a curve which shows 
the theoretical distribution of values of the maximum values of data samples 
which, in turn, are samples from some other distribution. A classic use case 
might be the following. Suppose a river runs through your property and you 
would like to know if the river is likely to rise enough to spill over your 
garden. You may know how high the river ran every day for the last ten years, 
but the only information that is relevant to you is the maximum height this 
year. Taking the maximum heights observed in each of the previous ten years as 
your data sample, you can compute their average and their standard deviation to 
find a Gumbel distribution which describes the probabilities of different 
ranges of river heights.

It is probably not true that anyone's chess performance respects the Gumbel 
distribution. One could draw lots of other curves which would be just as 
believable descriptions of performance. However, the Gumbel distribution is a 
convenient choice for the purposes of a few calculations.

If I tell you that GM Autobus' play is distributed like Gumbel random variable 
$A$, with mean play at rating $2550$, and FM 
Bindowcleaner's play is distributed like $B$, with mean play at $2150$, then 
we should have the expectation that Autobus will beat Bindowcleaner fairly 
frequently. For the sake of making up some point of reference to explain how 
big this difference in rating is in terms of winning percentage, we decide as 
convention that a $+400$ rating difference translates to probable winning odds 
of $10:1$. So Autobus should be able to score 10 out of 11 points in an 
11 game match against Bindowcleaner. In notation, write

$$\frac{Pr(A\text{ beats }B)}{Pr(B\text{ beats }A)} = 10^{\frac{R_A-R_B}{400}}.$$

On the left is denoted the odds of a random variable pretending to be Autobus 
playing at a higher level than a random variable pretending to be 
Bindowcleaner. To say that "$A$ beats $B$" is to say that $A$ takes a number 
value higher than $B$. On the right is an expression of those odds in terms of 
assumed 
rating; if the difference $R_A-R_B$ is equal to $+400$, then the righthand 
expression evaluates to $10$. If $R_A-R_B=+800$, then the righthand expression 
evaluates to $100$. This makes sense. If Stockfish 14, the chess playing 
machine, has an assumed rating of $2950$, then it should beat Autobus with odds 
10 to 1. If it then faced off against Bindowcleaner, then it could do the 
following. It could say, "Hey GM Autobus! Why don't you play 101 games for me 
against Bindowcleaner? 
If you win, then we'll just say that I would have also won that game since I 
generally play better than you do. If you lose, however, then I will play the 
rematch against Bindowcleaner myself. 
Since I play better than you in 10 out of 11 games on average, I expect to be 
able to win 10 out of 11 of those 11 games that you are expected to lose to 
Bindowcleaner, thus preserving my legacy." Ignoring the ethical difficulty of 
convincing a human to play for a computer, 
much less 101 games, the takeaway is that this equation describes the scenario 
which we have sought to describe.

Let us algebraically extract some new information. Since it is vanishingly 
unlikely for $A$ to equal $B$ from a probability perspective, we will simply 
observe that _either_ $A$ beats $B$ or $B$ beats $A$ in our scenario. Ignore 
draws. Then 

$$Pr(A\text{ beats }B)+Pr(B\text{ beats }A)=100\%=1,$$

so 

$$Pr(B\text{ beats }A)=1-Pr(A\text{ beats }B).$$

Combining this with the first equation, we solve for $Pr(A\text{ beats }B)$ to 
obtain 

$$Pr(A\text{ beats }B) = \frac{1}{1+10^{\frac{R_B-R_A}{400}}}.$$
